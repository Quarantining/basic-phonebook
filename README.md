# basic-phonebook

Basic phonebook project in Python. The user can search, add, delete, and list all entries in the phonebook. This is a remake of a project I had worked on a few months ago. It's been a while and I wanted to revisit some of the concepts I learned about. I used some online resources, along with chatgpt, and my old project for reference, however all code is still written by me :)
